<p>Removable cushions often have a zipper on the back, making foam replacement easy. However, if your cushions permanently attach to the sofa, this easy option is not possible. Attached cushions do not have zippers, however, meaning that you must cut them open to replace the foam. In addition, all the issues mentioned by laura are. The upholstered seating was far too dried out to be restored. It is easy to keep your couch cushions in place and prevent them from sliding in the following ways.</p>
<h3 id="attached-cushions-are-very-common-on-sofas-which-are-upholstered-in-leather-as-leather-cushions-tend-to-be-slippery-and-slide-off-if-they-arent-sewn-to-the-frame">Attached cushions are very common on sofas which are upholstered in leather as leather cushions tend to be slippery and slide off if they aren’t sewn to the frame.</h3>
<p>If your cushions are attached, they are less likely to slide around. You can add a second layer if one layer is not enough. I too learned to never buy attached cushions again. It is at the bottom of the cushion where you will get the hidden zipper. We have a leather couch that was peeling and becoming very messy and ugly. That attached part if also a dust, hair, crumb total disgustingness catcher that we forget to clean, and it would never clean up well enough for a close up.</p>
