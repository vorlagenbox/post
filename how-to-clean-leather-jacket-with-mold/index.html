<p>It only takes one spore to start a mildew colony, so it�s important to remove mildew as soon as possible. The only reason that a leather jacket would get moldy is if there are any mold spores on it. Clean dried leather thoroughly with leather cleaner or very mild soap (like baby shampoo). Leather clothes, shoes, and accessories are prone to mildew and mold growth if stored in an area where moisture and heat levels are too high. If you can actually see mold, brush off what you can, but don’t force it. To clean leather, mix a solution of warm water and dish soap, dip a soft cloth into it, wring it out and wipe the jacket.</p>
