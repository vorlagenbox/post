It has a single colour with no antiquing or mottling. You may be able too see natural markings, but you will have to look closely to spot them. It is exclusively dyed using soluble dyes without covering the top with insoluble pigment or topcoat paint.</p>

<p>It is exclusively dyed using soluble dyes without covering the top with insoluble pigment or topcoat paint. You may be able too see natural markings, but you will have to look closely to spot them. Aniline leather is highly prized for the way it looks. Semi aniline leather is very rarely found in cars as its not as hard wearing and as easy to maintain as pigmented leather, some luxury cars have semi aniline leather in them like ferraris. The pigment layer is very thin and the pores and creases of the hide show through but because it sits on top of the leather, brighter, more intense colour can be achieved. It has more consistent colours, but this does make it slightly.</p>

This will give some degree of extra protection but some shade variation should be expected.</p>
