<p><strong>Do Cats Like To Scratch Leather Furniture</strong>. The damage a cat’s claws does to leather can’t be buffed or polished out. In the wild, cats scratch their claws to remove the dead layer of claw (think of it like a cat manicure), which helps. The furniture may be slightly scratched from their running across it or jumping on it, but my experience is that cats don�t like to sharpen their claws on leather. When your cat wears her “fake” nails, she might still scratch your furniture, but she won’t damage it.</p>

<p>While a minor scratch will be easy to fix, a deeper tear in the leather is more serious and will require different procedures. If you put feliway on your furniture, it can make cats think they�ve already marked the area. I haven�t noticed sweaty legs, but i have noticed that a lot of leather couches are not comfortable so you really have to shop around for a comfy one. In the wild, cats scratch their claws to remove the dead layer of claw (think of it like a cat manicure), which helps. Also, most leather furniture has a topcoat sealant that. Though it is considerably stiffer than actual leather at first, it becomes softer and more comfortable with time.</p>

<p>Though it is considerably stiffer than actual leather at first, it becomes softer and more comfortable with time. Cats often scratch after waking up.
