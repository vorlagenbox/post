Fruit leather is a naturally sweet snack made by pureeing and dehydrating fresh fruit. They are then dehydrated or baked slowly, so that they dry out and make a chewy, tasty snack that can be healthy. If you like, you can turn your oven on as low as it can go every hour, then turn it off and let the residual heat dry out the leather.</p>
