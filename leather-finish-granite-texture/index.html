<p><strong>Leather Finish Granite Texture</strong>. But when a different shop does it, the leather finish might be rougher. In addition to the brilliant colors of granite you will find amazing textures. We are not lovers of shiny surfaces, so neither the marble nor the granite is shiny. While it does retain more of the natural color, it’s more commonly used on darker stone.</p>

<p>But when a different shop does it, the leather finish might be rougher. Unlike polished granite, it has a textured surface that can be felt with the touch of a hand. While it does retain more of the natural color, it’s more commonly used on darker stone. Leathered granite is not shiny, glossy, or polished. My dh loves it and really has liked the leather look on several display sla. The leathered finish is matte and looks very elegant.</p>
<h3 id="the-leathered-finish-is-the-least-shiny-but-the-highest-textured">The leathered finish is the least shiny, but the highest textured.</h3>
<p>This is largely an aesthetic difference, but a leathered finish actually provides a bit more functionality and benefits compared to a polished one. Leathered granite is a finish option for your countertops that will leave the surface with a slightly matte appearance and highlight the natural contours and coloring of the stone. The granite will have the appearance of leather, hence the term ‘leathered granite’. We installed colonial dream granite in a leather finish last september in our laundry room. However, another one of the very appealing stone finishes is leathered granite. In terms of texture, it is somewhere between the polished and honed surfaces, not as reflective and glossy as a polished finish but with more depth than honed granite.</p>
