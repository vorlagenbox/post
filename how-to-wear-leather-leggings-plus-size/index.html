The only downside is the band is a little thick on the waist, so i can’t wear them with thinner dresses.

<p>I am very particular about my leggings, especially the ones i wear as an “outfit.” spanx and zella are the only ones i wear on the daily. Super hot faux leather leggings. For a casual look, i paired my leggings with a grey sweater and wide brim hat. When it has an asymmetrical hem, it gives an artsy look. Perhaps the best thing about these leggings is how much they look like real leather. The only downside is the band is a little thick on the waist, so i can’t wear them with thinner dresses.</p>

<p>The only downside is the band is a little thick on the waist, so i can’t wear them with thinner dresses. It was actually about plus size long tops to wear with leggings. The two front seams also make them look like expensive trousers, rather than sporty leggings and, even better, they fit beautifully. I wear one size up in spanx leather leggings (a small). Depending on your work environment, you can even wear these babies to the office. Choose your fabrics with care:</p>
