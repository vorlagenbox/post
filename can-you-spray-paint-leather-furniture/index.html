<p><strong>Can You Spray Paint Leather Furniture</strong>. Using a paint and primer in one isn’t necessary since you have already thoroughly primed your piece. Paint in temperatures between 50 degrees fahrenheit and 90 degrees fahrenheit with a humidity below 85 percent to ensure proper drying. In this project, we used paint, prep and finisher made by angelus. It will take some patience to use spray paint, so be ready for the time commitment.</p>

<p>Apply 1 coat of gesso first, let it dry for 1 day, then apply the spray paint. One of the benefits of using chalk paint on leather is that it replicates the stiff feel of leather while still allowing for the give needed for the leather item. Are you looking to add a pop of color or a unique design to a leather surface? You can paint leather furniture, shoes, and even coats. You cannot beat the finish with pro sprayers, but they do come with a few downsides, namely initial price and cleaning. Be sure to shake each can of spray paint for a full minute before using.</p>

I swear i don’t work for angelus brand or know anybody who does, but for now i can’t think of anything bad to say about the results.</p>
