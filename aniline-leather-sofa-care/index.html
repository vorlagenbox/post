<p><strong>Aniline Leather Sofa Care</strong>. As such, a degree of natural marks and shade variation should be expected. When you’ve invested in a new leather sofa, you want to protect it from spills, stains, rips and tears for as long as possible. Aniline leather — also called pure aniline, full aniline or unfinished leather — has a soft, luxurious feel. The drawbacks of aniline leather are that it marks easily, readily absorbs liquids and the dye can fade over time.</p>
