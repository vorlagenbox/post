<p>The aniline leather is known to change, stain and mark, to soften into the rich patina over time. But some rightly argue that it’s just as tough or durable. Top grain leather is a type of leather known to be the second best; Top grain leather, and full grain leather, provide incredible durability and function. This is reflected in the cost to the consumer. Full grain leather has the complete grain intact and undergoes the least post processing at the tannery.</p>
<h3 id="the-word-top-often-confuses-seekers-of-the-finest-leather-because-it-infers-that-it-is-the-tops-in-quality">The word top often confuses seekers of the finest leather because it infers that it is the tops in quality.</h3>
<p>Top and full grain leather. Imitation grain gets stamped into the leather to give a more uniform look, but no genuine grain remains. For some articles we may occasionally use top grain leather, this is usually done when an even, more uniform look is required for the product. This leather is probably the most used leather in handbags, where a pristine look is desired. Grain leather is made from the strongest, most dense, part of the animal hide. Prospero comfort is a very thick belt (up to 2.8 mm), with the waistline up to 44 inches;</p>
