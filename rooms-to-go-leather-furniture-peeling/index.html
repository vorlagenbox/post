<p>Bonded leather is back in the courts. Leather reclining living room sets from rooms to go. The peeling leather story you have been covering is a manufacturers defect issue and not a protection plan issue. Rooms to go could care less. Very dissappointed with rooms to go! Rooms to go requires a down payment equal to sales tax and delivery.</p>

<p>In 2015 the chair started to peel in the seems. To my surprise thesectional started peeling. It is frustrating that i have paid over $1,000 for a couch that hardly lasted 3 years. Resolved rooms to go — leather sofa peeling i�ve had been a rooms to go repeat customer for over 20 years and never have i been so disappointed with quality of merchandise. The peeling leather story you have been covering is a manufacturers defect issue and not a protection plan issue. Do you think rooms to go will do anything to remedy this situation.</p>
