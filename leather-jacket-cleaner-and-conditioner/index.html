<p>When we started our search for the best leather cleaners on the market, we looked for those that were well priced, used as many natural ingredients as possible, and could actually be used on more than just leather jackets. It comes with a unique ingredient that protects the leather from uv rays. Leave it in a cool dry place for 5 days, lay flat one day on its backside, the next day on its front, etc. Part of the reason leather conditioner is so great is because it is able to get below the dirt and filth on the surface of the leather and lift it away. A leather jacket is such a cool thing to have! Consider using a naturally derived conditioner to keep your leather jacket or other garments supple and soft.</p>
