Muskin is the new vegan leather on the block, made from mushroom caps and tanned with nontoxic ingredients, unlike leather made from the skin of cows or other animals.

The new biodegradable material is softer, more breathable, and more water repellent than leather derived from animals—perfect for everyday items such as belts, purses, and shoe.
