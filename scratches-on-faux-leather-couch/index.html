<p><strong>Scratches On Faux Leather Couch</strong>. Cracks in faux leather are going to appear because of low maintenance! With some shoe polish and a couple rags, you can repair your leather furniture yourself. That oil isn�t going to stay on the surface of the leather, but instead will keep on traveling through the rest of the leather to the back. Leather wears well, and part of the charm of leather apparel is that the more it wears, the softer it gets.</p>

<p>Let�s say you decide to fix scratches on a leather couch by rubbing it down with olive oil. If it’s only a light scratch, this can usually be solved by using leather oil or conditioner. It looks a lot better, right? Leather wears well, and part of the charm of leather apparel is that the more it wears, the softer it gets. Due to this, it frequently gets damaged. Use short, circular motions to get an even finish.</p>

<p>I don�t think you will be able to get rid of the smell with any quick fix. There’s no such thing as a cat proof couch, but in terms of sofa materials that rank best for cat owners, leather is probably #1 or #2 on the list. Step 1 clean the damaged area. Sofas made with wood or metal frames are less susceptible to scratches, while cushions made with crypton or faux leather are resistant to stains and are easy to clean. Most faux leather is made from vinyl and closely matches the look and feel of real leather at only a fraction of the cost. I’m sure that most of you think that faux leather is as robust and as durable as really leather, but this is totally untrue, real leather is much stronger than faux leather, this is why faux leather requires lots of attention and lots of efforts from your part to make it stand time and the environment.</p>
