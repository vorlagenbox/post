<p><strong>Mold On Leather Boots</strong>. Whether it’s a leather jacket, leather purse, leather boots, leather shoes, or even leather tack, it’s always disappointing to see that you are dealing with a mold problem. It only takes one spore to start a mildew colony, so it�s important to remove mildew as soon as possible. If the problem is not addressed quickly, the growth can permanently damage leather surfaces, discolor white leather, and easily spread to other items. In a bucket, mix together 4 cups of lukewarm water and 2 drops of liquid dish soap.</p>

Isopropyl alcohol works very well for killing mold, however it must be tested in a small hidden area first, such as on the edge of the shoe tongue or underneath a flap, as the alcohol could remove the dye on the leather or have other adverse effects.
