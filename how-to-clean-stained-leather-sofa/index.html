<p><strong>How To Clean Stained Leather Sofa</strong>. A leather sofa is a really elegant and beautiful piece of furniture, but we can all agree that it requires some special care to keep it in perfect condition. Press the towel against the stain so you don�t spread it. A ratio of one tablespoon of vinegar to one cup of water will suffice. If staining remains you will need to consult a specialist since dyeing of the fibers has occurred.</p>

<p>Press the towel against the stain so you don�t spread it. Let penetrate 10 minutes, and buff out excess oil with a new, clean cloth. Add a few drops of vinegar as well, if the leather is particularly dirty. Remove all seating cushions if possible, and let the leather air dry for at least 1 hour. If the stain is still visible, apply a layer of acetone as a cleaning solution and leave it on overnight. Then, you can make a bucket of equal parts of vinegar and water to clean all of the stubborn stained areas, you can also use cream of tartar and lemon juice paste to get off really stubborn stains.</p>
