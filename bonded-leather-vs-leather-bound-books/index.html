<p><strong>Bonded Leather Vs Leather Bound Books</strong>. Bonded leather is made up of scrap leather and polyurethane, which makes it a cheap, fake leather. When you compare bonded leather vs genuine leather, the difference is night and day. Bonded leather�s primary purpose is to fool uneducated consumers into believing they are buying genuine leather furniture (or something similar) at a cheap price. Bonded leather is made from the scraps and fibers leftover from manufacturing genuine leather, mixed with a polyurethane binder.</p>

<p>It is left unfinished, meaning it has completely unique characteristics, creases, and coloring. Real leather is taken from an animal hide. When it comes to bonded leather, the cons really outweigh the pros. Full grain leather only uses the very highest (closest to the air) layer of skin, which is the toughest, most durable, and most beloved. The leather for bibles can be bonded and still very easily create the desired look and feel. For quarter bound books only the spine is leather, the rest of the cover is another material.</p>

<p>Bonded leather is a low quality leather: It�s composed of 90% to 100% leather fibers. • the look and feel of the two leathers is the same though real leather is harder to feel than bonded leather.

For quarter bound books only the spine is leather, the rest of the cover is another material. Full grain leather only uses the very highest (closest to the air) layer of skin, which is the toughest, most durable, and most beloved.</p>
