<p>Pigskin leather is less expensive than cattle hide. I read your article about pig skin shoes.you said if someone wear anything that has pig skin leather, his salah is invalid. The girl at danier (a leather goods store) had to look it up in her. It is amazing that many muslims do not know if they are actually wearing a leather jacket or a shoe or carrying a purse or any other leather product that is made of pigskin. These shoes as sold dont have any information about the leather being used. Globally, there are about 950 million pigs (as of 2005) and almost 100% are slaughtered annually.</p>
