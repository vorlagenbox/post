<p>My advice to all person suffering from skin problem, you can give basix skin repair cream a try and you won�t be dissapointed! The main reason for this is due to the lack of advancements in the chemistry of leather repair products. A leather conditioner for a sofa might contain very different ingredients than one made to condition leather shoes. It contains unique ingredients such as lanolin, jojoba oil, silicones, softeners,cleaning agents and a uv protector. This helps with constant supply, colour consistency and colour matching. The type of leather conditioner you choose should be formulated specifically for the leather goods you will use it on.</p>

<p>My advice to all person suffering from skin problem, you can give basix skin repair cream a try and you won�t be dissapointed! Then i�ve tried basix skin cream.
