<p><strong>Leather Jacket In Rain Damage</strong>. I have read that rain ruins leather, so i was wondering if the jacket is ruined and if there�s anything i can do to save it. If your leather jacket gets dirty, clean it with a damp cloth if the leather is finished or a dry cloth if it�s. Today, i was caught under a heavy rain while wearing my leather jacket. Leather waterproofing treatments wear away over time, so you will have to reapply regularly.</p>

<p>Rain and snow wash away leather�s natural oils and can cause your jacket to stiffen. This ensures that the product will not damage or discolor the leather. I have read that rain ruins leather, so i was wondering if the jacket is ruined and if there�s anything i can do to save it. Carrying an umbrella and using a silicone spray, for example, will make a world of difference. When water bonds with the oils, it weakens the protein bonds that hold the fibers together, so they�re more likely to break. Leather waterproofing treatments wear away over time, so you will have to reapply regularly.</p>

<p>Water will simply bead and roll off the leather, and the jacket will be no worse for wear. The longer leather remains saturated in moisture, the greater the risk of damage. Also, i have been in the rain several times in my leather jacket. I really appreciate your help. This ensures that the product will not damage or discolor the leather. This seals the pores in the leather.</p>
