<p>The value of bonded leather is not only reflected in its cost, but in the durability of the leather product itself. You can always slow down the process even if you cannot stop it entirely. Flaking, peeling leather is usually a disintegrating synthetic called bonded leather, though it can be a poor quality or damaged finish on real leather or vinyl. The first step is to clean the couch to prepare it for. It is made from scraps of real leather that are glued together to form a sheet. So i bought bonded leather sofas being told they were real leather ðŸ˜• it started peeling within 2 years.</p>

<p>We can perform leather couch repairs on bonded leather if itâ€™s caught early and starts in a small area, but if severe peeling or cracking is affecting the entire couch, it cannot be repaired. Real leather lasts much longer than bonded leather. To fix faux leather thatï¿½s peeling off your furniture, start by pulling off any loose bits of material so youâ€™ll have a clean surface to work with. Also, since the natural fibers are not exposed, this type of leather cannot be treated and conditioned like natural leather. Despite looking and smelling like the real thing, bonded leather upholstery consists mostly of plastic with a small amount of leather dust mixed with resin applied over the top. That original peeling brown bonded leather chair shown above is mine.</p>
