<p>The rest of the couch looks fine. Keep in mind that if you need to match any other of your rv furniture in the future, it’s a lot easier to match real leather. Real leather is easier to match. Faux leather is cheaper than real leather, and oftentimes easier to clean. But for owners of faux leather sofa, it takes more effort to maintain and keep it to its best condition. These are perfectly engineered peel and stick leather patches that come with a pressed edge for the neatest and most smooth finish.</p>

<p>These are not to be confused with vinyl (pvc). Hence, such a highly scratched and old couch cannot be repaired. Faux, bonded, bicast, or polyurethane leather delaminates, exposing a woven or microsuede polyester backing that absorbs water. Through water and sun damage, leather can lose its luster and flexibility, leading to hardening and eventually breaking apart of the fabric. But for owners of faux leather sofa, it takes more effort to maintain and keep it to its best condition. They then told me that they would �repair� any defective furniture or replace the cushion for up to one year then after that i am on my own.</p>
