<p>Most leather purses allow you to turn the lining outward for a detailed cleanup using a lint roller. After applying this over the leather’s surface, feel free to let it air dry. I would also recommend this as the way to always clean fine leather purses. Add a few drops of vinegar as well, if the leather is particularly dirty. By taking careful steps to remove unwanted stains, organize, and preserve, your purse can become clean and stay clean. Use a second clean, damp cloth to wipe off the soap.</p>

<p>To extend its life and to keep it looking new, regular cleaning of your leather purse is paramount. The inside lining of a handbag can get some heavy use, with the day to day items you place in it, keys, make up tissues, pens and more. Gather three soft, clean white rags, and then mix a bit of mild soap or detergent with warm water. If your lining is one that isn’t attached to the outside of the bag, pull it out and give it a quick pass with a lint roller. When your purse needs a lighter cleaning, mainly for bacteria and mold, and has no visible stains, this the procedure that i recommend. Wet a rag and add a small amount of soap.</p>
