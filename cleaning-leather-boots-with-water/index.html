<p>Nubuck is sensitive to humidity therefore direct contact with water should be minimized. Continue rubbing the spot until it is gone. So there�s no denying how important it is to clean them regularly. In addition, if you have cleaned the inside of the boot, you can stuff them with newspaper for 30 minutes to get rid of the excess water and reduce the drying time. Let’s talk now about how to waterproof them. They constantly strike the ground making contact with dirt, snow, salt, grime, and greasy substances.</p>

<p>Rub the mayonnaise into the spot with a soft cloth using a circular motion. You need to remember that moisture, as mentioned before, is extremely devastating and damaging to the faux leather fabric, especially if it’s old! Use a soft cloth or a brush to remove any grime that may be stuck to the shoe’s leather surfaces. Dab the stained parts of the boots. For instance, nylon and rubber boots can often just be thrown in the washing machine or given a firm scrubbing. Just like with the cleaner you are going to want to follow the directions suggested by the conditioner manufacturer.</p>
