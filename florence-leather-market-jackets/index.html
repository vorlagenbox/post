<p>Come and watch as expert artisans work leather bags. I have never purchased a leather jacket in florence or rome but have purchased several beautiful handbags in florence. Leather jackets costing less than £180 might be made in italy, but the leather may come from elsewhere. The main market, mercado di san lorenzo, is the trap that got me. A friend that lived in. No visit to the city should leave out a morning or afternoon spent exploring the stalls �bancarelle� of the leather market in the san lorenzo district or the mercato central selling produce from all over tuscany.</p>
