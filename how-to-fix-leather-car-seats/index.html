<p>Dispense tear mender into a disposable bowl or cup. Apply a small amount of glue on the edges of the tear so the leather sticks to the cloth, then allow the glue to dry completely. Any jacket or sofa surface wears out, gets faded, so, it’s great to renew its glare still before any rips or holes appear. Clean and condition your seats with a specialty leather cleaner. If you walk around with tools in your pockets, don’t be surprised if you tear a hole in your leather car seat, sofa or easy chair. Dip your finger in the tear mender and use it to fill in the low points of the cracks and surface tears.</p>
