Yes, you definitely can use acrylic paint on leather shoes, and let me tell you, they will make your kicks pop out like no others! Yes you can… what kind of paint should you use?

<p>Painting leather boots is a great way to update your wardrobe or breathe new life into an old pair, but certain steps must be followed in order to preserve the life of your paint. Yes, you definitely can use acrylic paint on leather shoes, and let me tell you, they will make your kicks pop out like no others! White leather paint is also a popular choice, so is black leather paint. Bottles if you’d like to test a few colors before applying (similar to testing paint swatches). Paint leather with angelus paints. Next, while you are waiting for the shoes to dry you can mix the acrylic paint with a fabric medium.</p>
<h3 id="finish-with-an-acrylic-finisher-for-a-gloss-or-matte-finish">Finish with an acrylic finisher for a gloss or matte finish.</h3>
<p>If you clean and prep the leather, select the right paint, and use a leather finisher, you can paint an old leather item a completely different color without damaging the leather itself. Add it to whatever color acrylic paint you use. You should consider leaning more towards cloth or canvas shoes. Next, while you are waiting for the shoes to dry you can mix the acrylic paint with a fabric medium. If you are worried about your design getting damaged by water, you can spray your finished shoes with an acrylic sealer spray (for cloth shoes) or even a clear matte spray paint (for leather shoes). A good way to express your unique style is by customizing them with paint.</p>
