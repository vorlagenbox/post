<p><strong>What To Clean Leather With Before Dying</strong>. Hi, just had a quick question for the leather sheath makers. Acetone would dry out the leather, and you are right, the fumes would be awful. Keep in mind that burnishing an edge with gum tragacanth will essentially seal the edge, so if you�re going to dye the leather, do it before you burnish. (above is a dyed and burnished edge!) if your dyed leather will be anything but decorative, you�ll need to seal it to keep the dye in place.</p>

<p>Hi, just had a quick question for the leather sheath makers. Pour the alcohol onto your rag, not the surface itself. It is important to make sure your leather is clean before starting the dying process. We have a full range of products for leather restore and dying the leather of everything from furniture to shoes to saddles visit our leather restoration &amp; dyes section. Then, gently brush the powder off with a clean cloth. Work the soapy solution into the leather so it can remove dirt hiding in the pores.</p>
<h3 id="work-it-into-the-stain-with-a-soft-cloth">Work it into the stain with a soft cloth.</h3>
<p>Dip a clean cloth in the saddle soap solution and scrub the leather surface. Hydrated leather will better receive the dye. If the leather is very dirty, clean it first with the leather cleaner. I have read somewhere that it is good to rub the veg tan with oil before dyeing because it helps the leather to absorb the dye or stain. Acetone would dry out the leather, and you are right, the fumes would be awful. Am trying to achieve a more even dye, and was wondering what is most recommended in terms of cleaning and deglazing?</p>
