<p><strong>How To Make Leather Earrings With Cricut Maker</strong>. I like faux leather earrings rather than making leather earrings as cutting the faux leather is easier and much lighter in weight. I decided why not try to make them myself. It�s not only a cool shape, it�s also got bling. I have the cricut maker, which i highly recommend for jewelry making, available at amazon here.</p>

I’ve made leather earrings before using my silhouette and i must say that the cricut maker was much easier. To make the earrings from basswood you will need to have the cricut knife blade and the cricut strong grip mat.if you want to you could use this file to make this same shape earring from a different material like leather. Last week i shared some designs for halloween hair bows and got such a lovely response that i thought i’d create some matching earrings to go with them!. It’s a very simple, fun project and when you’re done you get cute earrings to wear or gift to others. Peel away the transfer tape to reveal the earrings.</p>
