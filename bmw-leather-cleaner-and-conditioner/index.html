<p>A good leather conditioner should restore the moisture back to the leather and give it a shiny, supple, and soft look. I use it on my cars about every other month. They also have a quick leather cleaner as well. Bmw actually makes a really good conditioner for the leather. It also preserves the original characteristics of the leather surface. I have zaino leather, meguiers leather spray and the bmw leather cleaner and conditioner.</p>
