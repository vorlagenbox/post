<p>However, some men forget to take care of their shoes, leaving them with scuffed, cracked and beaten shoes. For instance, there are leather car seats, leather sofa sets or couches, leather jackets, leather shoes, leather belts, leather office seats and many more. I can understand wanting a cap shine but what goes on in the mind to apply conditioner? I like saphir renovateur and use it from time to time but i still recall the horror when it took off the antiquing on a relatively new pair of shoes. Once dry, treat your soles with a leather conditioner, to keep them from cracking, peeling, and/or separating. This is a great leather conditioner for cars and other leather items.</p>
