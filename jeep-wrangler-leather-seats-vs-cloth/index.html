<p><strong>Jeep Wrangler Leather Seats Vs Cloth</strong>. We offer several options so be sure to look at everything. Of cloth seats isn�t compromised vs the mandatory leather in the xpkg, then i guess i could always do the aftermarket leather upholstery (as long as the shape/comfort of the seat cushioning is as good as that with factory leather). I sweat enough in my other car�s leather seats nevermind a jeep that won�t have a top/ac going). Once your info is locked in you will be able to choose your leather content.</p>

<p>Of cloth seats isn�t compromised vs the mandatory leather in the xpkg, then i guess i could always do the aftermarket leather upholstery (as long as the shape/comfort of the seat cushioning is as good as that with factory leather). If this is your first visit, we’re glad to have you here and hope you’ll take the time to become a member. But since the jeep can do heated seats with cloth, i�m curious what actual wrangler owners can tell me. We offer several options so be sure to look at everything. With the leather i can just wipe it down and with the cloth seats i am never able to get all the dust out of the seats. I am hoping that with the tan leather i can get durability and reduced heat.</p>

<p>I don�t have any big preference for leather over cloth, it just happens that almost all my cars have had leather since until recently that was the only way to get heated seats.</p>

<p>The leather seated vehicles i�ve had were hot in the summer and cold in the winter, even with heated seats it took longer to get hot, than my heated cloth seats.</p>
