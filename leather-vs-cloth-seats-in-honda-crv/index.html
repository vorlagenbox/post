<p>Upon remarking my continued disdain at honda�s choice of only offering certain options on the trim line with leather seats, the salesman responded to me that they were not actually <em>real</em> leather. Having to heat and cool seats is stupid. Your seats are your first and last contact with your vehicle, and also the primary feature for passengers. Its front seats are comfortable, and its back seats offer plenty of space for adults. Maybe the difference is more like $2,500 after discounts. Leather generally cleans up much easier than cloth and that is a huge consideration for me especially after a few drink spills.</p>
