<p><strong>Fix Leather Seat Scratch</strong>. I will be trying the leather scratch method this weekend. I guess most of the car owners once came across a tear, rip or scratch on your car leather seat and of course, you can’t be in a good mood in the situation. With most car seat situations, many professionals will recommend that the entire seat gets replaced if the damage is severe. There is plenty you can do yourself in terms of leather seat repair using items you already have in the house.</p>
