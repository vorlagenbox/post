<p>Never spray paint your sofa outside in an uncovered area unless you�re positive the weather will remain fine. The beast now looks like a high end leather sofa! Art supply 24 color acrylic airbrush, leather &amp; shoe paint set opaque colors plus reducer, cleaner &amp; color mixing wheel. Once the leather has been prepared to accept the paint, you will need to prime the material using a solution made up of one part acrylic paint and one part water. You may change your mind about toning it down after you’ve lived with it a few weeks. Painting the leather inlay centers is just what these tables need for a fresh new look!</p>
