<p>So if you need to clean or condition any leather furniture or your car seats, i hope you will try out my useful idea for this homemade leather cleaning process. This is a great recipe for those of you who use wood heat or have forced heat air in your homes and it works really well on leather car seats and even those great leather jackets that you have hanging in the closet.

If the leather on your car seats has become rough and hard, then you need to use a leather conditioner to soften up the material. Knowing how to clean leather will extend the life of your car seats and keep them looking new. It is inexpensive and easy to make.</p>
