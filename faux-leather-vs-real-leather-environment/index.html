<p><strong>Faux Leather Vs Real Leather Environment</strong>. We spoke to designers on both sides of the argument to try and discover the most sustainable way to be. When sourced from sustainable ranches and tanned naturally, real leather actually has the potential to be less damaging to the environment than most faux (or “vegan”) leathers (excluding the rare vegan leather options made from cotton or cork). On the other hand, you’ll find fake leather which looks as good as real leather but for a fraction of the cost. Leather has a timeless appeal.</p>

The environmental impact of animal leather vs faux leather as supporters of ethical fashion initiatives, you already know how big of an impact your choices are having on the welfare of animals. Real leather has an inviting feel, it provides exceptional durability, and quality leather improves with age.

Faux leather is known as vegan leather because the material used is never from animal skins but although this is a huge benefit for animal activists, the manufacture of synthetic leather is not beneficial to the environment or humans due to the toxins in the plastics used to make them. Faux leather (also referred to as “leatherette” or “vegan” leather) is often considered as a lower cost alternative to genuine leather. Faux leather also tends to stretch more than real leather.</p>
