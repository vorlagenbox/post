<p><strong>How To Fix Cracked Leather Bag</strong>. Through water and sun damage, leather can lose its luster and flexibility, leading to hardening and eventually breaking apart of the fabric. Leave to dry completely and apply some leather conditioner in order to maintain a good level of oil and wax in the leather. Unfortunately, faux leather also ages like its natural counterpart and may begin to show signs of wear after several years of use. One major type of damage can cause the leather to crack and eventually peel.</p>

As for fixing cracked leather, there’s some good news and some bad news you need to know about. A cloth or even the back of a spoon works well for this. I have a leather chanel bag that i bought at yardsale 5 years ago. I was wondering if anyone has had this problem with their bag (doesn�t have to be bally).

<p>I have a leather chanel bag that i bought at yardsale 5 years ago. Faux leather is a practical and stylish alternative to the real thing. Rinse your cloth again and rub it over the leather surface to remove any soap. With this constant use and lack of care, the pressures placed on a leather can cause it to crack. You can apply a cracked leather repair compound for this step, but we recommend dabbing the cracking areas with mink oil or neatsfoot oil. If the inside of a crack is lighter in colour than the surface using a dye is your best option.</p>
