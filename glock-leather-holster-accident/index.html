<p>The wait time for a kydex is often measured in days. But the holster don�t fit the gun. One prime example is a leather holster with thumb break release. Just pick your gun from a list).

<p>The wait time for a kydex is often measured in days. Using some of the best quality leather around this iwb holster for your glock 42 looks the part due to its classic leather look, which also provides great comfort when wearing. When re holstering on the run, a dea friend of mine tried to holster the glock 19 and the leather strap got inside the trigger housing as he pushed the pistol into the holster, deactivated the trigger safety and tripped the trigger. The holster is opened ended which is nice if. Every durable part of this holster is double reinforced from the single belt loop, that features double stitching, with the double stitched opening of the holster. During the the process the trigger caught on the top edge of said leather holster that bent into a crease and got trapped inside the trigger guard.</p>
