<p><strong>What Vegan Leather Means</strong>. Vegan leather is often made from polyurethane, a polymer that can be made to order for any designer’s whim. But what is vegan leather?

To call something “vegan leather” is a misnomer, selling to those ignorant of the fact that it is not leather in anyway shape or form.</p>
