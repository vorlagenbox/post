<p><strong>Can You Spray Paint Leather Chairs</strong>. Yes, you can spray paint leather, just go really, really slowly.

<p>Pick a paint meant for multiple surfaces. Some sand it afterward with 230 sandpaper or even finer to smooth it out before applying the color based paints and the final glossy coat. Paint in temperatures between 50 degrees fahrenheit and 90 degrees fahrenheit with a humidity below 85 percent to ensure proper drying. Hold the paint can at least 6 inches from the chair to eliminate paint runs. If you own leather furniture, you�ve already made an investment worthy of years of enjoyment, so don�t let water damage decrease the look or usability of your leather chairs or sofa. I put three different paints to the test on three of the exact same chairs and was pretty surprised with the results.</p>
