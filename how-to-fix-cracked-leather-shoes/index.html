<p>Good quality leather boots should last you for a lifetime, but you will need to give them a little care and attention to keep them looking great. Shoe cream is a great product for treating cracked leather since it will not only color the cracks in the leather but blend the color of the entire item. So, wait an hour or so until the shoes are completely dry before moving on to the next step. It�s impossible to completely avoid scraping leather footwear. Don�t worry, cracked leather repair isn�t as hard as you may initially think. Saddle soap is a soap blend developed for cleaning leather, especially with “horse tack,” or items associated with riding horses.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-step-before-you-attempt-to-fix-the-cracks-is-to-clean-the-leather-thoroughly-using-saddle-soap">The first step before you attempt to fix the cracks is to clean the leather thoroughly using saddle soap.</h3>
<p>In addition to leather�s sophisticated look, it�s durable, easy to care for and comfortable. If the shine has disappeared and cracks have appeared on your leather boots, do not rush to move it to the top shelf of the cabinet. Leather shoes are an investment, and the longer we have them, the more comfortable they are. How do you make old leather shoes look new? Stuffing a dish cloth into the shoe will help keep the shoe stiff as you work the mink oil into the leather with the back of a metal spoon. As leather emanates from animal’s skin, it tends to crack if neglected as it loses its natural hydration.</p>
