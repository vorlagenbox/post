<p>But did not like the finish. Another bonus was that both the paint and the gloss finish are acrylic and had no odor at all. $100 ðŸ™ˆ was my budget for a couch. What you really need to do is get some new leather and some upholstery nails and cut the leather and place it on top of the leather that is currently on the couch and use the nails to secure it in place. Get paint from leather with a blunt knife or scraper. Takes 2 hours to paint an entire couch.</p>

<p>I did add the high gloss layer because the finish of the paint itself was more like a satin. Let it sit for a few minutes until you can peel the paint off carefully with your fingernail or the knife. To complete the process, shelley first washed the sofa with sugar soap and lightly sanded the leather. Many of the youtube videoâ€™s on fixing faux leather suggest multiple layers of a matte clear paint to seal the areaâ€™s flaking and prevent further flaking. Painful truth is my dream couch has a price tag of $2,800. These paint materials were bought direct from the manufacture and very reasonably priced at about $6 per bottle.</p>
