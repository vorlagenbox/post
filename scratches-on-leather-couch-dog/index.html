<p>The couch doesn’t have a cut or tear, simply a bunch of scratches. I just tried the olive oil and it helped some. Then, as the leather surface begins to dry out again, the oil returns. Leather can seem a very durable material, but when scratches appear, they can show easily and be very hard to ignore. That oil isn�t going to stay on the surface of the leather, but instead will keep on traveling through the rest of the leather to the back. This can cause the claws of your pooch to scuff or scratch the surface of leather furniture.</p>
