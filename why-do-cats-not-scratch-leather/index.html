<p><strong>Why Do Cats Not Scratch Leather</strong>. For having furniture, do not punish cats. Cats would tend to leave leather alone as long as they have a proper exercise post. So why do cats like scratching posts? As your cat is getting used to not scratching your furniture, you can keep him out of the room he�s been destroying, especially when you�re not there to coach him to scratch appropriate things.</p>

<p>Cats have a natural instinct to scratch for a variety of reasons. And you don’t want that. It is due to the fact that cats enjoy scratching right after waking up as an instinctive reflex. I’m not sure it’s fair to say that there are many cats who ‘like’ to scratch leather furniture. They often target prominent objects within their territory (your home) including couches, chairs and curtains. So a cat scratching post is perfect for them.</p>
<h3 id="im-not-sure-its-fair-to-say-that-there-are-many-cats-who-like-to-scratch-leather-furniture">I’m not sure it’s fair to say that there are many cats who ‘like’ to scratch leather furniture.</h3>
<p>In addition, it does not provide an attractive place for a cat to dig into due to its solid feel. The most likely place a cat will scratch a sofa is the sides or armrests. If you�re a cat person with leather furniture, you know how much they love to sink their claws into it. If they don’t have any place to scratch then your furniture, carpet and couch will be scratched! If your cat has a cat bed it uses, or if it normally sleeps in a favorite chair or windowsill, you might try placing the scratching post near there. Truth is, cats will scratch almost anything.</p>
