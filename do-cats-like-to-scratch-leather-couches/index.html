<p><strong>Do Cats Like To Scratch Leather Couches</strong>. Keep in mind that cats scratch to mark their territory. When you take your scratching post home, put it in a place where your cat frequents. A better question is whether cats will scratch leather furniture. Cats do it to sharpen and clean their nails and stretch back muscles.</p>

<p>It�s easily scratched and, once pet claws hit leather, the material is never the same again. Leather furniture may look great in your home, but it can also attract the attention of your cat. Scratching is a very common feline behavior that can do serious damage to your expensive home furniture. Thus, he is encouraged to scratch on the post more if it is spotted near the sleeping area. The problem with this is that whether it takes your cat a week, month, or even a year to start scratching your leather sofa, once they do it’s too late. It is not resistant to scratches either.</p>
<h3 id="it039s-actually-a-prime-target-for-cat-claws">It�s actually a prime target for cat claws.</h3>
<p>It is due to the fact that cats enjoy scratching right after waking up as an instinctive reflex. But cats need to scratch something, and a leather couch is often going to be the victim. But it�s not the best couch material for cats: It�s actually a prime target for cat claws. For the most part, microfiber simply doesn’t collect signs of scratching like claw marks, holes, pulls, or tears. A mild glue attaches the nail covers, and they stay on for four to six weeks.</p>
