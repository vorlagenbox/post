<p>Because leather is normally not labeled, you never really know where (or whom) it came from. Leather made from an adult cow taken from the prime areas of the animal are some of the best leather you can find. But it is very durable, able to withstand a lot of abuse. Real leather (not synthetically made) is made from animal skin, and more commonly cow hide, although goat, buffalo and exotic leathers such as snake and alligator are also available. Cows leather is often described as a byproduct from the meat and dairy industries, making up just 5% of the value of the animal. Cattle are not the only animals killed for their skins.</p>
