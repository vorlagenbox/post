<p>If you have your own buckle, and are ordering a belt without a buckle, there are two things you will need to determine when you order. Stay safe and healthy and onto another one &lt;3. Chicago screws allow you to swap out your belt buckle if the need arises. A dozen years ago i bought a simple leather belt from a street vendor at a fair of sorts.

Insert the middle pin of a belt buckle through the first hole on the leather blank and fold the leather strap down.</p>
