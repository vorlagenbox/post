<p>The leather seat does not need to go to an auto repair shop to be fixed. However, some car seats are made up of other types of materials such as vinyl or suede, or nylon which is quite difficult to repair. If you walk around with tools in your pockets, don’t be surprised if you tear a hole in your leather car seat, sofa or easy chair. Purchase a kit with a color compound that matches your leather. If a perfect repair is important, call a pro to fix it (about $150). The kits that require heat are easier to use, but they tend to be much weaker.</p>
<h3 id="the-leather-repair-dye-also-acts-as-an-adhesive-so-the-loose-flaps-will-be-stuck-down-once-the-dye-dries">The leather repair dye also acts as an adhesive, so the loose flaps will be stuck down once the dye dries.</h3>
<p>If that doesn�t work, you can then price out a new or used panel for replacement, or find an automotive upholstery shop to repair it. “aside from replacing the seats, there is no way to repair gashes or tears in the leather that make it look flawless.” You’ll still see the tear after the leather seat repair, and you probably won’t get a perfect color match. But don’t expect perfection when you try to fix a leather car seat. The best leather repair kits are designed to give you professional results, even if you have never done this before. If that doesn�t work, you can then price out a new or used panel for replacement, or find an automotive upholstery shop to repair it.</p>
