Take the cushions out and vacuum underneath them as well. Keep leather clean, conditioned, and properly stored to prevent mold from returning. If mold or mildew has developed on your leather pieces, it can be removed with a few simple steps.</p>

<p>Allow leather to dry for a second time. Since leather for a couch, chair, or bolster is usually thick, you can use white vinegar or rubbing alcohol solution (color check is still necessary, just in case). Over time, it can degrade the leather finish. After you have safely removed all of the mold from the leather item, apply a leather conditioner to protect it. If furniture gets damp, it may become moldy. Whether it’s a leather jacket, leather purse, leather boots, leather shoes, or even leather tack, it’s always disappointing to see that you are dealing with a mold problem.</p>
<h3 id="if-there-is-no-reaction-then-you-can-start-cleaning">If there is no reaction then you can start cleaning.</h3>
<p>However, keep it out of direct sunlight to prevent fading and discoloring the leather. If furniture gets damp, it may become moldy. Not only will the cleaning process release mold spores into the air, which can be dangerous inside your home , but the sunlight can also help to kill mold. Let the unfinished leather piece air dry. If you discover mold or mildew on your leather couch, don’t panic! That means that the summer time is a perfect time for your furniture to grow mold when left in a dark storage facility.</p>
