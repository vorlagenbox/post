<p>Place furniture away from vents and windows. Our cleaning products work thoroughly but gently and are matched to the different types of leather finishes. By conditioning the fabric, you moisturize the leather, which keeps it flexible. A leather piece of furniture is a joy to own, but it requires the right kind of care to prolong its life and keep it looking beautiful. As leather ages, it loses moisture, which can lead to cracks and obvious wear. Conditioning your leather furniture retains this moisture, reducing cracks from wear and tear over time.</p>
