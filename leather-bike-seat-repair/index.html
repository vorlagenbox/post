<p>There are companies out there that do leather repair work but this can be costly so here a few home remedies you can try at home first to see if you can get that leather looking brand new again. We can repair the metal parts of most leather saddles. A leather bike seat must be of high quality and rigid enough to keep its form over the long term, otherwise you’re just wasting your money. Apply a small amount of glue on the edges of the tear so the leather sticks to the cloth, then allow the glue to dry completely. A solid repair will see any dirt and rust removed before a base coat, colour coat, and a protective lacquer are applied. Brooks stocks and supplies replacement parts;</p>
