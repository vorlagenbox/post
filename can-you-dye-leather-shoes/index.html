<p><strong>Can You Dye Leather Shoes</strong>. If you have an aniline leather, you can soak it in dye. There aren’t many techniques to know about the faux leather fabric you are dealing with unless you are an expert, what you can do is simply test the fabric yourself. I’d recommend trying the dye first on a small (not as noticeable) portion of the shoe or a piece of leather that is a similar color to what your shoes look like before dying, to be sure you’ll like it before your dye the whole shoe. So now you see that an old pair of shoes can always be revitalized and made to look new and fresh again!</p>

<p>Technically you aren’t dyeing leather: Instead, i found a pair of lovely nude leather boots that i decided to dye navy. Let the stripper dry for 10 minutes. So now you see that an old pair of shoes can always be revitalized and made to look new and fresh again! Only add one drop of each color at a time until you get the color you want. You are staining it, and this means that you can colour almost any colour leather shoe to almost any other colour.</p>

<p>Allow to dry, and repeat until desired result is achieved, gradually blending outward for a uniform appearance. (above is a dyed and burnished edge!) if your dyed leather will be anything but decorative, you�ll need to seal it to keep the dye in place. Dye penetrates deep into the grain. Wet a rag with shoe stripper and wipe your shoes thoroughly with it. So now you see that an old pair of shoes can always be revitalized and made to look new and fresh again! You are staining it, and this means that you can colour almost any colour leather shoe to almost any other colour.</p>
