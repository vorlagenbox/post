<p>This can cause the claws of your pooch to scuff or scratch the surface of leather furniture. My dog ruined my weekend when i came home friday to find that she scratched the heck out of the bottom of the couch trying to get her tennis ball. If you end up with an accident start by using our cleaning and conditioning and if you need more. Giving your dog treats for hanging out on the floor sends a pretty clear message to your dog: Remember from the beauty aisle that leather is porous, so it absorbs liquid. Another reason a dog may dig at your couch is if she is nesting.</p>
