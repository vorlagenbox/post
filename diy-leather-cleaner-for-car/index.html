<p>Apply a small amount of leather cleaner (about the size of a quarter) to a microfiber cloth. Chamberlain’s leather milk is as effective on car leather as it is fun to say. Mix 1/2 cup olive oil with 1/4 cup of vinegar in a spray bottle. Just mix the two ingredients together in your spray bottle and shake it well. Our couch is badly �abused� with all sorts of harsh agents not meant for leather. Safflower oil is commonly used to moisturize skin and absorbs quickly, so i assume.</p>

The best leather conditioner for your car isn’t actually a “conditioner” at all! Just mix the two ingredients together in your spray bottle and shake it well. Wipe up spills as soon as they hit the seat. For upholstery, you can use a cloth or scrub brush to clean.</p>
