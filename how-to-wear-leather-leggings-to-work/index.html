<p>But, i’ve never before put together a ten ways to wear these beauties… the classic staple… the faux leather leggings! I like this look so much that i found another pair of faux leather leggings that were on sale. No one will notice that under them you are actually wearing a piece for a gym clothes. You can also wear faux leather leggings to work if you pair your leather pants with monochrome blouses, regular fit shirts and a blazer. It all arrived today and i will try it out in the next day or two. The sweater is roomy with a statement collar which balances the slick and fitted look of the leggings.</p>
