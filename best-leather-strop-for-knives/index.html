<p><strong>Best Leather Strop For Knives</strong>. This diamond paste has a very fine grain enabling you to get the best sharpening results. When you shop with amazon, you can feel confident about the quality of your purchase. The original 4 wide �barefoot leather strop� is still my best seller but as bushcraft has become so popular in recent years i now make slightly smaller and lighter 3 wide versions that can be carried in a backpack. It’s a great starter kit and like the strop above, it offers ample of room to work on larger knives.</p>

<p>We make�em right here in the knives plus shop and test each one to be sure it works right! Stropping is the opposite motion of sharpening. Posted by december 30, 2020 leave a comment on best strop for kitchen knives. The original 4 wide �barefoot leather strop� is still my best seller but as bushcraft has become so popular in recent years i now make slightly smaller and lighter 3 wide versions that can be carried in a backpack. I used a softer leather, from what i have read you want a little give in the leather so it curves a bit on the edge. I buy my leather for stropping from �jantz knifemaker�s supply.� i buy a square of veggie tanned leather, 12x12 for $10, and cut it into three 4x12 strops.</p>
