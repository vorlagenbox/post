<p><strong>Cleaning Mold From Leather Seats</strong>. Cleaning with soap many people don’t realize this, but it is possible to clean leather with soap. Avoid applying too much conditioner, which will sit on top of the leather, making the seats greasy or slick. Red rot is a condition that breaks down the structure of old leather. It’s eliminated the mold and dirt, and the door is now sanitized and free of mold spores and germs.</p>

<p>Let the unfinished leather piece air dry. Dry out leather item in a warm room until completely dry. Remove surface mold with a damp cloth (mold will wipe off if the leather has been dried completely). There are many different ways to clean leather, and we are about to show you the most aggressive way. Apply the conditioner to the seats and use a microfiber cloth or sponge to gently massage or rub it into the leather. Treating leather works a little differently than cleaning the carpet or your bathroom tile.</p>
<h3 id="when-it-comes-to-cleaning-mold-off-leather-it039s-all-about-the-type-of-leather-that-you039re-dealing">When it comes to cleaning mold off leather, it�s all about the type of leather that you�re dealing.</h3>
<p>For unfinished leather, clean using saddle soap instead. Wipe down the leather seats and finishes, and get another dam… well, because while vinegar can certainly kill mold, it’s not the strongest solution out there, and the more porous the leather … a cleaning expert and advice columnist. You may also notice that the seat will lighten a bit. This is the warm water removing excess dirt and dust from the vinyl, not a discoloration due to the bleach. Avoid applying too much conditioner, which will sit on top of the leather, making the seats greasy or slick. Yet, leather is also notoriously difficult to take care of.</p>
