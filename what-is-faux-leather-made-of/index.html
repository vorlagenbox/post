<p>Flooring, car parts, pipes, plastic furniture, you name it. It can be very hard to tell the difference from this and protected leather as the finish is very much the same. The artificial grain is typically very uniform. It seems obvious, but real leather will smell like skin and fake will smell like plastic. Some cars made in the 70s are still enjoying their faux leather upholstery, it is because the faux leather fabric used was of great quality and was made of mixed materials and fabrics. Although it may look like leather and feel like leather it has a glaring difference from real leather.</p>
<h3 id="this-kind-of-leather-is-affordable-and-less-durable-because-it-cracks-over-time">This kind of leather is affordable and less durable because it cracks over time.</h3>
<p>There are various alternate options in the market and they could opt for those instead. Pu leather fabric is made by applying or laminating a 100% polyurethane finish to a base material.

There’s now a range of more responsible, eco friendly and sustainable ways to source and produce real leather. This is a man made product, designed to give the look and feel of real leather at a lower cost.</p>
