<p><strong>Lems Boulder Boot Leather Vs Waterproof</strong>. Their closure system employs different hardware—the boulder boot operating with punched metal eyelets while the tracker fg using a combination of hooks and loops. I wear a size 43 in the breatho trail though, and that fits me perfectly. I’m loving my barefoot sandals and shoes and need a new pair of boots for the winter so i figured, why not go barefoot? First, the upper part of the boot is 1200d nylon with nubuck leather accents around the heel, toe, and collar.</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-lems-boulder-boot-leather-unique">What makes lems boulder boot leather unique:</h3>
<p>Even some boots made from leather can be carefully selected to be “lightweight”. They are adorable, but not so compatible with the muddy terrain of the pacific northwest trail ways. I’m liking the lem’s boulder the most i think, but i’m a vegetarian and would really rather buy something other than leather. As the title says, is the only pair of the boulders that are waterproof the leather variety? However, after one month of use cracks in the leather began appearing on the sides of the toe box.
