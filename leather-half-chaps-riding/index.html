<p>I also have a pair of ariat half chaps made from leather. They’re a great alternative to full chaps. They offer the benefits of tall boots with less maintenance, less break in time, and a more affordable price. Look hot, be cool, wear protection. Hot xs s m l xl 2xs 3xs 4xs 5xs. Top brands like perri�s leather, tredstep ireland or ovation.</p>

<p>Horseback riders wear half chaps as protective gear to shield their lower legs from the brush and branches encountered riding prairies, woods and trails. Hot xs s m l xl 2xs 3xs 4xs 5xs. I have been so impressed with them and wear them every time i ride. Like full chaps, half chaps are usually constructed of sturdy leather, to provide the greatest amount of protection. English half chaps also assist with keeping the leg in the correct position with their grip. A great alternative to full chaps, half chaps are easy to put on and take off, and fold up small to store in your saddle bag.</p>
