<p>These are the best faux leather leggings! January 4, 2021 january 4, 2021. The smalls looked very small on the hanger, but the sales associate helping me said to go with my true size, and that they would stretch and mold to the body throughout the day. Because of the amount of wear i get out of my classic spanx leather leggings, i ordered them in the same size, ready to spend the rest of quarantine sitting on my couch in patent leather. Review &amp; styling august 13, 2020 1 comment. Two of which definitely have the “fake leather” look, but have a ton of reviews, while the other one looks more like the spanx faux leather leggings, but the reviews are okay.</p>
