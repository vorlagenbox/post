<p><strong>How To Paint Faux Leather Furniture</strong>. It really gives a beautiful look to outdated or worn out leather. Most faux leather products are made of vinyl and we don’t recommend painting with acrylics on top of vinyl without the use of a vinyl primer first, due to plasticizer migration that can come between the paint layer and the vinyl causing the paint layer to fail. Using blue painters tape, tape off any areas you don’t want to faux leather paint. Paint in temperatures between 50 degrees fahrenheit and 90 degrees fahrenheit with a humidity below 85 percent to ensure proper drying.</p>
