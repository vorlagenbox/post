<p>I have tried a number of commercial cleaners over the years with mixed results. For water stains, you can use water to treat the stain. Or you may also spray directly onto the leather and wipe down the leather couch. The oil will always remain on the top, so be sure to constantly shake the mixture on each spray. One good way to ensure that the furniture will wear well is to keep it clean. Combine 1 teaspoon of natural dish detergent (the kind used for hand washing dishes) with 16 ounces of water in a spray bottle.</p>
