<p><strong>What Is Nubuck Leather And How Do You Care For It</strong>. The nubuck and suede leather care kit has been designed to provide you with the exact products that are formulated specifically for gentle nubuck and suede leather. One of the most important things you can do when it comes to nubuck shoe care is to brush them regularly. Although many buyers confuse nubuck and suede because both types of leather have a soft feel. Dubbin is designed for mainly smooth leather and can damage the ‘furry’ feel of nubuck and suede as a result of this changing its appearance and is also most likely to stain.</p>

<p>Oils and other grime can stain the nubuck, so care needs to be taken when wearing it outside. They are formulated to shine, retain suppleness and prevent leathers from drying out. Never you apply dubbin wax to suede or nubuck leather boots. For shoes, do the same or simply go over the shoes with a nubuck brush. Regular wiping with a nubuck cloth will prevent you from having to resort to leather degreaser and leather cleaner. Secondly, such products are nice to wear, they do not absorb moisture (almost), and the artificial nubuck leather care is much easier than caring after natural nubuck shoes.</p>
<h3 id="an-essential-tool-in-your-arsenal-for-cleaning-nubuck-shoes-is-a-good-suede-brush">An essential tool in your arsenal for cleaning nubuck shoes is a good suede brush.</h3>
<p>The only downside is that nubuck picks up dirt easily, so you have to regularly clean your nubuck boots. If there is a scuff on the shoe, wait till you get a moment of free time and buff it out. To care for nubuck leather is not always easy once it shows signs of wear, and it is particularly difficult to recolour in case of colour loss. Nubuck, while strong and durable, tends to stain and soil easily. It’s similar to suede, and looks elegant on boots. The best time to spray this protectant is after cleaning your nubuck surface.</p>
