<p><strong>Bonded Leather Vs Genuine Leather Vs Faux Leather</strong>. Bonded leather�s primary purpose is to fool uneducated consumers into believing they are buying genuine leather furniture (or something similar) at a cheap price. Actual leather content while genuine leather is made from the lower quality layers of the hide, it is leather nonetheless. Like many people, you may not have had reason to stop and ask exactly what that means, or how it differs from other types of leather. Bonded leather can smell more like genuine leather than artificial.</p>

What you need to know if you’ve ever shopped to furnish your living room or office, you’ve likely encountered the phrase ‘bonded leather’ at some point. Bonded leather is made, in short, by taking all the leftover scraps of leather bits and pieces and smashing them together with a “bonding agent” and then, as with genuine leather, painting it and pressing it to make it look like it is one sheet of leather. Full grain vs top grain vs genuine vs bonded vs faux leather. It is so common that a significant proportion of the leather furniture sold is bonded leather. Actual leather content while genuine leather is made from the lower quality layers of the hide, it is leather nonetheless.</p>
