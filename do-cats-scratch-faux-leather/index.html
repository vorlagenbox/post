<p><strong>Do Cats Scratch Faux Leather</strong>. It�s actually a prime target for cat claws. The truth of the matter is that your cat may just scratch your sofa because when he/she gets the itch to scratch around it, there’s nothing else nearby that. Our kitten did this instead of her scratch post at night sometimes, we just moved her posts near the sofa, no capping needed :p. A mild glue attaches the nail covers, and they stay on for four to six weeks.</p>

<p>Try to have at least 4 thin coats of finish to get an adequate protection layer. It�s easily scratched and, once pet claws hit leather, the material is never the same again. Cats who scratch furniture will be drawn to microfiber�s soft feel, but the ultrafine synthetic fibers are more likely to let your cat�s nails slide right past than fray like traditional fabrics. Denim is not 100% smooth, plus the look of it, even when the cats scratch it, you cannot notice it. Most cats avoid leather provided a scratching post is readily available as an alternative. As professional repair artisans, we learned to walk away from this kind of damage, because perfection is impossible.</p>

<p>Leather is not the type of fabric  to have with cats. Perhaps it’s because leather can be quite hard for their claws to get purchase or because it’s just too cold and unfriendly, that many cats would prefer to leave it alone. I also used a vinyl repair solution which i bought from a shoe repair shop that did leather/faux leather shoes. From the photos below, select what type of cat damage you have, and then follow the correct guide on how to repair the scratches. It is due to the fact that cats enjoy scratching right after waking up as an instinctive reflex. We know that cats vary too — some cats might claw leather, some might not.</p>
