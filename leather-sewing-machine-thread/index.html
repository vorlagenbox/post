<p><strong>Leather Sewing Machine Thread</strong>. There are a number of things to know about sewing with leather on your home machine, besides the obvious rule of not using leather that is too thick. The sewing thread used for leather increases in diameter and strength as its number increases. When sewing leather with a domestic machine, there are a few settings that you will need to adjust.

<p>The threads uses for hand sewing leather are normally rated by the number of cords that are twisted and waxed together. The thread to use is either silky or polyester threads, the former is the best but expensive, it isn’t used by many. But this thread is more of a ribbon style, wide body look that doesn’t look too good with fine leather. Since hand operated sewing machines can cost very little and can typically stitch through very thick pieces of leather, i believe that if you don’t want to spend a lot of money in an industrial machine that can only sew straight stitches. Bonded nylon thread is a superb choice of thread to sew leather, and it comes in a variety of weights that pair well with different weights and thicknesses of leather. The cost of hand sewing machines specially made to sew through heavyweight materials varies from $120 to $1,000.</p>
