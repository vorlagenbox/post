<p>Leather is a very forgiving material, and just a small amount of regular care goes a long way. The best tip for cleaning a leather sofa is to clean it using saddle soap or leather dew (a combo of soap and oil usually available from shoe repair shops and good furniture stores) once a week with a soft cloth. Consider hiring a professional leather cleaning service every 3 to 4 years or when the leather sofa or chair is heavily soiled. Attach the brush tool to the vacuum’s hand tool and run the brush over the leather of the couch. Step 1, remove large debris with a vacuum. Using the vacuum’s hand tool, remove any debris from the sofa.</p>
<h3 id="leather-furniture-can-be-cleaned-using-simple-household-products">Leather furniture can be cleaned using simple household products.</h3>
<p>Wipe any excess liquid up immediately with a clean absorbent cloth or sponge. Apply some alcohol to a cotton swab and gently rub it into the ink stain. Some furniture makers recommend doing nothing more than dusting unprotected aniline leather with a clean, dry cloth and vacuuming it regularly using a soft brush. Any other cleaning products, particularly household sprays, can strip away the leather’s natural oils, causing it to dry out and crack over time. One small area at a time, work a leather cleaner, like gh seal star weiman leather cleaner and conditioner or furniture clinic leather care kit, or mild soap into the leather with a soft, damp cloth. Keep it sheltered position your leather furniture strategically to keep it away from direct sunlight, away from the ac, and far from the fireplace.</p>
