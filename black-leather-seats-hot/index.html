<p><strong>Black Leather Seats Hot</strong>. If you have black or dark grey seats, here is a easy fix. This can be a real problem. Yes it gets very hot. So if you have tan seats, the tan color is sprayed on, or black seats, the color is sprayed on etc.</p>

<p>By far our biggest beef (sorry, we had to say it) with leather here in australia is just how damn hot it gets during the summer months. Usually only luxury vehicles, which are themselves expensive, come standard with these types of car seats. We live in florida and have a black on black 3 and knew the car and seats would get hot, but after a good tinting the seats are totally reasonable with preconditioning and the car cools off quite fast. Also, if you�re scared of hot seats, put a towel on your seat. Do the same on a frigid winter morning. The summer is almost over here in socal and it is only, yes i know only, about 100 degrees by us now, time will tell next year in the middle of summer how hot they.</p>

So if you have tan seats, the tan color is sprayed on, or black seats, the color is sprayed on etc. “during the summer,” said marty strasen of tampa, “the seats can get hot enough to melt the elastic in your underwear.” if you leave the windows up on a sunny summer day in arizona, the temperature in the car can exceed 200 degrees. Black leather seats will get hotter because of its heat absorption, greenhouse effects, etc. Or really drunk friends prone to puking in your car. I once had a convertible with a black leather interior.</p>
